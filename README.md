# Robot-Neck
The purpose of this task is to make the neck of the robot rotate by 180 degrees. For that, we used two DC motors that will make the neck rotate. This code is for the demonstration of the task. First, the motors will rotate clockwise for 3 seconds. Then, it will rotate anti-clockwise for 3 seconds.
